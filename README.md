# advent-of-code2024
 
I have been doing this year's Advent of Code with the goal of beating every other year.

Embarrassingly I have only ever completed 5 stars worth before (2 days of 2 stars + 1 day of 1)

This year I have already surpassed it, 3 days 3 stars. I'm aiming to get as far as I can, but I'm not going to be upset if it gets too complex for me at some point.
